# AskRight — UI Copy for Micro-Tips & Stages

Purpose: ready-to-use copy for stage-specific guidance in the playground. Keep tone calm, direct, and educational. Place near the prompt input or feedback area; avoid modals.

## Onboarding (first run)
- “You’ll see what your prompt did, why, and how to improve. No scores—just clarity.”
- “Pick a model, paste or type a prompt, then run it. We’ll coach the prompt, not the output.”

## Fundamentals (intent + context)
- “State the goal in one sentence. Add who/what it’s for.”
- “Add missing context (audience, domain, examples) so the model doesn’t guess.”
- “If you don’t know something, say so—ask the model to flag unknowns.”

## Structure (constraints + format)
- “Add constraints: tone, length, must-include items.”
- “Specify the output shape (bullets, table, JSON schema).”
- “Tighten scope: one task per run.”

## Control (scope + reasoning)
- “If the task has steps, ask for the steps. Keep them short.”
- “Tell the model what to do when info is missing (e.g., ‘say unknown’).”
- “Ban filler: ask for concise answers only.”

## Reflection (after iterations)
- “What changed and why? Check the diff—did clarity improve?”
- “Did you add context, constraints, and format? If not, pick one to tighten now.”
- “If output drifted, restate scope and format together.”

## Template Suggestions (lightweight prompts)
- “Try a pattern: summary, analysis, compare, extract, or critique.”
- “Use a template, then edit intent + context to fit your case.”

## Upgrade Nudges (educational tone)
- “You’re practicing well—tokens refresh with Pro or use your own API key.”
- “Keep iterating without limits: add your key or go Pro.”
